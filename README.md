# AI

Hello! I created this GitHub account as part of my participation in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). The focus of this program is on AI-Empowered Cybersecurity, where we leverage artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) to address various cybersecurity challenges.

**About My Research**
My research specifically aims to protect small businesses from ransomware attacks. Small businesses are often targeted by cybercriminals due to their typically limited cybersecurity resources. By using advanced AI techniques, I am developing a system capable of:

_Detecting Ransomware Attacks in Real Time_: Utilizing LLMs and other AI tools, my project focuses on identifying ransomware threats as they occur.
_Providing Preventative Measures:_ Beyond detection, the system will offer actionable recommendations to prevent future attacks.
_Offering Detailed Explanations:_ For each detected threat, the system will provide a comprehensive explanation, helping users understand why an email or action was flagged as malicious.
This project is a step toward creating a safer digital environment for small businesses, empowering them to defend against the increasing threat of ransomware.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the progress and contributions in this exciting and crucial area of cybersecurity.
